      <p>
        Mongolian warrior and ruler Genghis Khan created the largest empire in
        the world, the Mongol Empire, by destroying individual tribes in
        Northeast Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genghis Khan was born "Temujin" in Mongolia around 1162. He married at
        age 16, but had many wives during his lifetime. At 20, he began building
        a large army with the intent to destroy individual tribes in Northeast
        Asia and unite them under his rule. He was successful; the Mongol Empire
        was the largest empire in the world before the British Empire, and
        lasted well after his own death in 1227.

      <div class="text-main">
        <p>
          Born in north central Mongolia around 1162, Genghis Khan was
          originally named "Temujin" after a Tatar chieftain that his father,
          Yesukhei, had captured. Young Temujin was a member of the Borjigin
          tribe and a descendant of Khabul Khan, who briefly united Mongols
          against the Jin (Chin) Dynasty of northern China in the early 1100s.
          According to the "Secret History of the Mongols" (a contemporary
          account of Mongol history), Temujin was born with a blood clot in his
          hand, a sign in Mongol folklore that he was destined to become a
          leader. His mother, Hoelun, taught him the grim reality of living in
          turbulent Mongol tribal society and the need for alliances.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Temujin was 9, his father took him to live with the family of his
          future bride, Borte. On the return trip home, Yesukhei encountered
          members of the rival Tatar tribe, who invited him to a conciliatory
          meal, where he was poisoned for past transgressions against the
          Tatars. Upon hearing of his father's death, Temujin returned home to
          claim his position as clan chief. However, the clan refused to
          recognize the young boy's leadership and ostracized his family of
          younger brothers and half-brothers to near-refugee status. The
          pressure on the family was great, and in a dispute over the spoils of
          a hunting expedition, Temujin quarreled with and killed his
          half-brother, Bekhter, confirming his position as head of the family.
        </p>

        <p>
          At 16, Temujin married Borte, cementing the alliance between the
          Konkirat tribe and his own. Soon after, Borte was kidnapped by the
          rival Merkit tribe and given to a chieftain as a wife. Temujin was
          able to rescue her, and soon after, she gave birth to her first son,
          Jochi. Though Borte's captivity with the Konkirat tribe cast doubt on
          Jochi's birth, Temujin accepted him as his own. With Borte, Temujin
          had four sons and many other children with other wives, as was
          Mongolian custom. However, only his male children with Borte qualified
          for succession in the family.

    <div style="position:relative;">
      <div class="text-main">
        <p>
          When Temujin was about 20, he was captured in a raid by former family
          allies, the Taichi'uts, and temporarily enslaved. He escaped with the
          help of a sympathetic captor, and joined his brothers and several
          other clansmen to form a fighting unit. Temujin began his slow ascent
          to power by building a large army of more than 20,000 men. He set out
          to destroy traditional divisions among the various tribes and unite
          the Mongols under his rule.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through a combination of outstanding military tactics and merciless
          brutality, Temujin avenged his father's murder by decimating the Tatar
          army, and ordered the killing of every Tatar male who was more than
          approximately 3 feet tall (taller than the linchpin, or axle pin, of a
          wagon wheel). Temujin's Mongols then defeated the Taichi'ut using a
          series of massive cavalry attacks, including having all of the
          Taichi'ut chiefs boiled alive. By 1206, Temujin had also defeated the
          powerful Naiman tribe, thus giving him control of central and eastern
          Mongolia.
        </p>

        <p>
          The early success of the Mongol army owed much to the brilliant
          military tactics of Genghis Khan, as well as his understanding of his
          enemies' motivations. He employed an extensive spy network and was
          quick to adopt new technologies from his enemies. The well-trained
          Mongol army of 80,000 fighters coordinated their advance with a
          sophisticated signaling system of smoke and burning torches. Large
          drums sounded commands to charge, and further orders were conveyed
          with flag signals. Every soldier was fully equipped with a bow,
          arrows, a shield, a dagger and a lasso. He also carried large
          saddlebags for food, tools and spare clothes. The saddlebag was
          waterproof and could be inflated to serve as a life preserver when
          crossing deep and swift-moving rivers. Cavalrymen carried a small
          sword, javelins, body armor, a battle-ax or mace, and a lance with a
          hook to pull enemies off of their horses. The Mongols were devastating
          in their attacks. Because they could maneuver a galloping horse using
          only their legs, their hands were free to shoot arrows. The entire
          army was followed by a well-organized supply system of oxcarts
          carrying food for soldiers and beasts alike, as well as military
          equipment, shamans for spiritual and medical aid, and officials to
          catalog the booty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the victories over the rival Mongol tribes, other tribal
          leaders agreed to peace and bestowed on Temujin the title of "Genghis
          Khan," which means "universal ruler." The title carried not only
          political importance, but also spiritual significance. The leading
          shaman declared Genghis Khan the representative of Mongke Koko Tengri
          (the "Eternal Blue Sky"), the supreme god of the Mongols. With this
          declaration of divine status, it was accepted that his destiny was to
          rule the world. Religious tolerance was practiced in the Mongol
          Empire, but to defy the Great Khan was equal to defying the will of
          God. It was with such religious fervor that Genghis Khan is supposed
          to have said to one of his enemies, "I am the flail of God. If you had
          not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me
          upon you."

      <div class="text-main">
        <p>
          Genghis Khan wasted no time in capitalizing on his divine stature.
          While spiritual inspiration motivated his armies, the Mongols were
          probably driven as much by environmental circumstances. Food and
          resources were becoming scarce as the population grew. In 1207, he led
          his armies against the kingdom of Xi Xia and, after two years, forced
          it to surrender. In 1211, Genghis Khan's armies struck the Jin Dynasty
          in northern China, lured not by the great cities' artistic and
          scientific wonders, but rather the seemingly endless rice fields and
          easy pickings of wealth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the campaign against the Jin Dynasty lasted nearly 20 years,
          Genghis Khan's armies were also active in the west against border
          empires and the Muslim world. Initially, Genghis Khan used diplomacy
          to establish trade relations with the Khwarizm Dynasty, a
          Turkish-dominated empire that included Turkestan, Persia, and
          Afghanistan. But the Mongol diplomatic mission was attacked by the
          governor of Otrar, who possibly believed the caravan was a cover for a
          spy mission. When Genghis Khan heard of this affront, he demanded the
          governor be extradited to him and sent a diplomat to retrieve him.
          Shah Muhammad, the leader of the Khwarizm Dynasty, not only refused
          the demand, but in defiance sent back the head of the Mongol diplomat.
        </p>

        <p>
          This act released a fury that would sweep through central Asia and
          into eastern Europe. In 1219, Genghis Khan personally took control of
          planning and executing a three-prong attack of 200,000 Mongol soldiers
          against the Khwarizm Dynasty. The Mongols swept through every city's
          fortifications with unstoppable savagery. Those who weren't
          immediately slaughtered were driven in front of the Mongol army,
          serving as human shields when the Mongols took the next city. No
          living thing was spared, including small domestic animals and
          livestock. Skulls of men, women, and children were piled in large,
          pyramidal mounds. City after city was brought to its knees, and
          eventually the Shah Muhammad and later his son were captured and
          killed, bringing an end to the Khwarizm Dynasty in 1221.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scholars describe the period after the Khwarizm campaign as the Pax
          Mongolica. In time, the conquests of Genghis Khan connected the major
          trade centers of China and Europe. The empire was governed by a legal
          code known as Yassa. Developed by Genghis Khan, the code was based on
          Mongol common law but contained edicts that prohibited blood feuds,
          adultery, theft and bearing false witness. Also included were laws
          that reflected Mongol respect for the environment such as forbidding
          bathing in rivers and streams and orders for any soldier following
          another to pick up anything that the first soldier dropped. Infraction
          of any of these laws was usually punishable by death. Advancement
          within military and government ranks was not based on traditional
          lines of heredity or ethnicity, but on merit. There were tax
          exemptions for religious and some professional leaders, as well as a
          degree of religious tolerance that reflected the long-held Mongol
          tradition of religion as a personal conviction not subject to law or
          interference. This tradition had practical applications as there were
          so many different religious groups in the empire, it would have been
          an extra burden to force a single religion on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the annihilation of the Khwarizm Dynasty, Genghis Khan once again
          turned his attention east to China. The Tanguts of Xi Xia had defied
          his orders to contribute troops to the Khwarizm campaign and were in
          open revolt. In a string of victories against Tangut cities, Genghis
          Khan defeated enemy armies and sacked the capital of Ning Hia. Soon
          one Tangut official surrendered after another, and the resistance
          ended. Genghis Khan hadn't quite extracted all the revenge he wanted
          for the Tangut betrayal, however, and ordered the execution of the
          imperial family, thus ending the Tangut lineage.

          Genghis Khan died in 1227, soon after the submission of the Xi Xia.
          The exact cause of his death is unknown. Some historians maintain that
          he fell off a horse while on a hunt, and died of fatigue and injuries.
          Others contend that he died of respiratory disease. Genghis Khan was
          buried without markings, according to the customs of his tribe,
          somewhere near his birthplace—close to the Onon River and the Khentii
          Mountains in northern Mongolia. According to legend, the funeral
          escort killed anyone and anything they encountered to conceal the
          location of the burial site, and a river was diverted over Genghis
          Khan's grave to make it impossible to find.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before his death, Genghis Khan bestowed supreme leadership to his son
          Ogedei, who controlled most of eastern Asia, including China. The rest
          of the empire was divided among his other sons: Chagatai took over
          central Asia and northern Iran; Tolui, being the youngest, received a
          small territory near the Mongol homeland; and Jochi (who was killed
          before Genghis Khan's death). Jochi and his son, Batu, took control of
          modern Russia and formed the Golden Horde. The empire's expansion
          continued and reached its peak under Ogedei Khan's leadership. Mongol
          armies eventually invaded Persia, the Song Dynasty in southern China,
          and the Balkans. Just when the Mongol armies had reached the gates of
          Vienna, Austria, leading commander Batu got word of the Great Khan
          Ogedei's death and was called back to Mongolia. Subsequently, the
          campaign lost momentum, marking the Mongol's farthest invasion into
          Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the many descendents of Genghis Khan is Kublai Khan, who was the
          son of Tolui, Genghis Khan's youngest son. At a young age, Kublai had
          a strong interest in Chinese civilization and, throughout his life,
          did much to incorporate Chinese customs and culture into Mongol rule.
          Kublai rose to prominence in 1251, when his eldest brother, Mongke,
          became Khan of the Mongol Empire and placed him as governor of the
          southern territories. Kublai distinguished himself by increasing
          agricultural production and expanding Mongol territory. After Mongke's
          death, Kublai and his other brother, Arik Boke, fought for control of
          the empire. After three years of intertribal warfare, Kublai was
          victorious, and he was made Great Khan and emperor of the Yuan Dynasty
          of China.
