    <h5 class="header header--small">What I learnt:</h5>
    <p class="p-text">
      I wanted to make more use of images and so use parallax scrolling on large
      displays, which I disable on smaller screens due to issues on mobile
      devices and parallax. These images are stored on a Google Firebase project
      folder than I reference.I have revisted and redesigned this page several
      times, most recently remaking it in flexbox and using Vue to help
      eliminate repeated code.
    </p>
    <p class="p-text">
      I learnt a lot about responsive images and backgrounds in general and
      several methods for creating a 'hero' image. I use the images at natural
      breaks in the content to divide up a text heavy page.
    </p>
    <p class="p-text">
      I read a lot about color schemes and noticed on smaller screens, where the
      picture is static the text was not easily visible so I added a faint
      background to allow the heading to still stand out.
