      It sets out a coding curriculum covering a broad spectrum of skills and I
      have covered areas including
      <strong>'Responsive Web Design'</strong>,
      <strong>'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Strutures'</strong>, and
      <strong>'Front End Libraries'</strong>. At the end of each course I am
      given projects and challenges to undertake, building on the skills learnt.
    </p>
    <p class="p-text">
      I like the structured layout to the learning and have often returned to
      this resource to recap my knowledge and enjoy finding that yes, I
      <em>have</em>
      actually remembered some of the skills!

      You can click through my projects above, and below I have recorded some
      thoughts on the challenges faced.
